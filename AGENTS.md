# Offline Wesnoth project instructions

Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` and `docs/BASELINE.md` before making changes. Keep these shared documents synchronized with the sibling `wesnoth_server` checkout when both are available.

The user builds a custom Android client and Windows 11 server for offline LAN gameplay. MongoDB is the chosen database; existing upstream Wesnoth does not provide the requested integration. Develop on the VPS, verify there where possible, commit and push authorized changes, then provide exact Windows commands, commit IDs, expected results, and logs to return. Windows builds and LDPlayer/device testing belong to the user. Do not claim they passed without returned evidence.

Preserve user changes and the supplied build tools/data. Confirm the Windows toolchain versions before pinning versions or upgrading dependencies. No dependency downloads during offline build/run. Diagnose against matching source/data versions.

Initial audit on 2026-10-11 found nearly all actual source/build files empty, and only README tracked in each repository. Recover intact originals before replacing custom code. Read the current baseline for updated status.

Never expose or commit `.env`, database credentials, tokens, signing keys, or raw Git remote URLs with embedded credentials. Stage only reviewed paths. Existing untracked source/build artifacts are not automatically safe to commit. After each cycle, update baseline status, verified checks, remaining limitations, and next steps.
